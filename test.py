    Converts an array of sentences (strings) into an array of indices corresponding to words in the sentences.

    X -- array of sentences (strings), of shape (m, 1)
    word_to_index -- a dictionary containing the each word mapped to its index
    max_len -- maximum number of words in a sentence. You can assume every sentence in X is no longer than this.
